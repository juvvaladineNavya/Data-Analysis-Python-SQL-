# Data-Analysis-Python-SQL

Here I have used Kaggle API to download the dataset and to data processing and data cleaning I have used pandas and loaded the data into MYSQL work bench, and I have answered some interesting business questions using SQL.



The data that I have worked on is sales order data set , data set link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders



Data cleaning and Data processing using python :

1 .  handle null values present in ship mode column

2. derived new columns discount , sale price and profit using existing columns

3.  Removed the unwanted columns

4. data type conversions: converted order date from object data type to datetime data type

5. Finally loaded the data from jupyter notebook to MYSQL workbench to perform data analysis



questions analyzed in sql:

* Find top 10 highest revenue generating products

*Find top 5 highest selling products in each region

*Find month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales eg : Jan 2022 vs Jan 2023

*For each category which month had highest sales 

* which sub category had highest growth by profit in 2023 compare to 2022
